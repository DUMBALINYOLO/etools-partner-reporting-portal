# Data Uploader for QPR and HR

For IP, we will be adding the ability to upload data for only 1 specific Quarterly Progress Report \(QPR\) or 1 specific Humanitarian Report \(HR\) at a time. This differs from Cluster Reporting as you can upload many reports at a time.

  
****There will be 2 additional buttons on each QPR or HR. They will be next to XLS and PDF download.
