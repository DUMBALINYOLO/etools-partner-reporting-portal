# Data Uploader for QPR and HR

For IP, we will be adding the ability to upload data for only 1 specific Quarterly Progress Report \(QPR\) or 1 specific Humanitarian Report \(HR\) at a time. This differs from Cluster Reporting as you can upload many reports at a time.

  
****There will be 2 additional buttons \(2 already there\) on each QPR or HR. They will be next to XLS and PDF download.

* Generate Uploader Template
* Import Template

If there is no data, Totals should be blank as opposed to 0 \([\#918](https://github.com/unicef/etools-partner-reporting-portal/issues/918)\)

### QPR uploader template: ****

User also will be able to add or modify text on upload template for QPR _**Other Info**_ section.  User can generate the template, upload with data.

User can generate the template, upload with data.



If report has been submitted or accepted \(not in draft basically\) these 2 additional buttons **should not be shown** and backend should not work as well.

The existing xls export and PDF buttons will always keep showing irrespective.
