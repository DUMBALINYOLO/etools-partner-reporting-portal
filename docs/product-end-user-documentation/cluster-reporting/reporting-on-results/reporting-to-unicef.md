# Reporting to UNICEF

The indicator reports tagged in blue represent indicators that have been associated in a PD this partner is assigned to. The reporting of the aggregate data happens to UNICEF with a certain percentage reported to UNICEF. See screenshots / details [here](../../ip-reporting/progress-reports/humanitarian-reports-hr.md#screenshots).

{% hint style="info" %}
A future use-case that PRP can be extended to support is the ability to be able to report progress to other agencies / funding sources as well, other than UNICEF.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a partner has not adopted this cluster activity in PRP-Cluster, but on of the cluster activity indicators is associated with this partner's PD in PMP, then PRP will assume adoption of this activity \(and all its indicators\) by this partner.
{% endhint %}

### Locations <a id="locations"></a>

The locations that show up for these indicator reports are a combination of ones the partner has added in PRP-Cluster and ones that might be configured for this indicator in this partner's PD in PMP.

Only locations that the UNICEF PMP expects are reported back. In PRP-Cluster all locations will show, but in PRP-IP only the ones configured in PMP for this partners' PD will show.
