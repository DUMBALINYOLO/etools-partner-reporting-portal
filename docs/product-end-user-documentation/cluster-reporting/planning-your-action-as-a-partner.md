# Planning your action as a Partner

In this section \("My Planned Action" in the left hand navigation\) of the interface is where the partner can view and setup their planned actions to support the work of the cluster. A checkmark will indicate whether a project is from OCHA. The IMO does not see this section.

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is only visible to a partner user who is logged in.

If we do have OCHA external ID, Partner can proceed with creating a project from OCHA or a custom project. If we donâ€™t have OCHA external ID, Partner will have to create custom project.

Business Analyst from UNICEF side will add the Organisation ID from [https://api.hpc.tools/v1/public/organization](https://api.hpc.tools/v1/public/organization) as OCHA External ID field in PRP Django Admin.

We will show basic details in a drop down so the partner knows which project they are pulling from OCHA. 

We will include all names of Funding Source because there might be multiple sources. Funding Source is not always available though so it will be optional. Total funding is not always available so it will be optional too. User can edit the funding source and total funding.
